## How it works

### Install

Before the installation, please make sure that you have Python (Only version 2 is supported and only 2.7 have been tested) installed.

If you have pip, simply enter ```pip install iconbuilder``` in your cli and iconbuilder should be installed correctly.

If you do not have pip, you could clone the repo and enter ```python setup.py install``` in your cli instead.

### Usage

1. You have to draw an icon with a large resolution(1024 * 1024 as an example). put it in your directory.

2. Make a new file named ```pixels.txt```. in this file, enter the new pixels as you want. Every desired pixel should be in a line.

3. Start a terminal and input ```iconbuilder```, then the program will look for the files and resize it to the pixels you want.
